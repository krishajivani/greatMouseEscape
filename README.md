## The Great Mouse Escape
“The Great Mouse Escape” is inspired by the Asteroids arcade game. The objective of the game is for the player (mouse) to evade the particles for as long as possible. If the mouse collides with a particle, the game ends and a score equivalent to the number of seconds survived is displayed on the screen. The slider controls the difficulty level; the lower the setting, the slower the particles move. 

If particles collide with one another, their colors combine (average rgb values together) to form a new color, the smaller particle disappears, and the large particle’s trajectory is continued. When a particle is within a certain radius of the player, the player’s “gravity” affects its trajectory. This makes it more challenging for the player to evade the particles that are close to it, making the game all the more interesting!
